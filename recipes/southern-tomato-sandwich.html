<h2>Description</h2>
<p1 class="paragraph">Tastes like summer! Room temperature tomatoes are key here and once the salt and pepper hit them, the juices start flowing. When the juicy tomatoes blend in with the mayonnaise, it makes a delicious, creamy, slightly tangy, and flavorful sauce. The bread becomes slightly soggy, in the best way possible. The last bite is even better than the first!" â€”NicoleMcMom</p1>
